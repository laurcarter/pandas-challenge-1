# Client Data Analysis
## Overview

This project involves analyzing client data to determine key metrics such as total units purchased, total shipping price, total revenue, and total profit for the top 5 clients. The analysis was performed using the Python pandas library. The results were formatted and presented in a sorted DataFrame based on total profit. The main file of this repository is wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb, which is located in Starter_Code/Resources.

## Tools and Resources
When there were errors, I resolved them using the following resources:

	• The Pandas DataFrame Documentation was invaluable for understanding the functions and methods available in pandas.
	• The Pandas Getting Started Guide helped me understand the basics and some advanced usage of pandas.
	• I used ChatGPT to troubleshoot errors and clarify doubts that arose during the project.
